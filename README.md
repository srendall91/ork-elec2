## Summary

A live data feed of the current electricity demand and generation in the Orkney Isles is published by Southern Scottish Electricity Network. https://www.ssen.co.uk/ANM/

When generation is likely to exceed the capacity of the transmission network, some generators are shut down to ensure network safety.  This is known as curtailment. A live feed refecting the current state of the network is also published. https://www.ssen.co.uk/ANMGeneration/

Logging these data feeds will provide a useful resource for future analysis. Methods of doing this are described here.

It is intended that by combining this data with archived weather records we can gain some insight into the into the systems involved and create a computer model that will be able to forecast electricity usage, generation and curtailment events.
