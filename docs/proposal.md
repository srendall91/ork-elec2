# A study into the feasibility of predicting windfarm electricity generation curtailment in The Orkney Islands by use of computer modelling using conventional and machine learning techniques.

## Summary

Curtailment (when electricity generation is reduced to prevent overloading transmission lines) limits income for many community owned wind turbines in the Orkney Islands, and reduces the overall benefits of this ‘clean’ energy source. 
It is proposed that by analysing generation, consumption, weather and other associated data it may be possible gain further insight into the systems involved and possibly create a computer model that will be able to forecast electricity usage, generation and curtailment events.

A better understanding of this system, will assist in developing alternative uses of the curtailed power, increasing the effectiveness and benefit of the turbines and income of the producers.

## Background

The United Kingdom's electricity distribution system, 'The National Grid', was originally designed to distribute power from a limited number of large power stations to the main population areas and outward to the more sparsely populated rural areas.  However, with the recent development in renewable and micro generation, this model has changed dramatically, and indeed in some cases even reversed, as increasingly, electricity is from smaller, more distributed resources. e.g. wind turbines tend to be situated in rural locations. Re-engineering and rebuilding the network to accommodate this change is expensive and time consuming, and consequently other methods have been investigated and utilised.

For example, Orkney is a group of islands off the north coast of Scotland, quite distant from large centres of population.  It has a relatively modest electricity consumption (6-34MW).  The sub-sea cables that connect it to the national grid, and hence the large power stations on mainland UK, were designed and installed to meet this requirement.  Since then, many wind farms and domestic wind turbines have been installed, utilising existing local 'Grid' cables and infrastructure. When weather conditions permit, they provide energy for the local community, and export any surplus to mainland UK using the original 'feed-in' cables. Conventionally, the amount of generation allowable on any particular part of the national grid would be such that it would be able to safely carry all of the power in conditions of maximum generation (i.e. on the windiest of days).  However, this would mean that the distribution grid is often operating well below its optimum capacity (i.e. on less windy days.  In 2009, Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution (SHEPD) introduced systems whereby additional generation could be connected to the grid on the basis that they would cease to feed into the network, when it was nearing its maximum safe capacity.  This situation is known as curtailment and the whole system is known as the Active Network Management System(ANM) or 'Smart Grid'.

Incidentally, SHEPD (2011) also acknowledged that standards regarding the power carrying capacity of overhead electricity lines were onerously cautious in the Orkney climate.  The relatively low atmospheric temperatures and cooling effect of the wind reduces the heating of the wires due to the current/power being transmitted.  As such this means that significantly more power can be carried safely for a given cable structure.  Thus, a system of weather dependant dynamic current management of overhead wires was implemented.

These innovations have allowed many additional generators to be built and installed, increasing the use of the available wind resource and local infrastructure on less windy days.

Many of these turbines are owned and operated by local community groups, earning them money directly.  However, it can be frustrating for them when the turbine is curtailed, particularly in apparently productive weather, depriving them of this income.
It can be noted that, whilst the electricity generated by turbines can and (when possible) is sold to the National Electricity Grid, the generators also receive a state subsidy for every unit (kWh) produced, even if it is not sold on.

Some solutions to this deprivation of income are being investigated and implemented.  On Eday(*ref*), an electrolyser has been installed that produces hydrogen which is sold on as fuel for vehicles fitted with fuel cells and berthed ferries. The production plant lead time and storage/demand/distribution issues make managing the balance between hydrogen production and feeding into the grid, in order to maximise income, a complicated problem.

Another project (*ref*) obviates curtailment by adding extra load onto the local network, such as storage heating and recharging electric vehicle batteries.  This utilises additional generated electricity and reduces the current/load on the export cables removing the need for curtailment.  Currently, the project relies on the curtailment signals sent by SHEPD. As the devices creating the additional load have a finite capacity there is scope to optimise the system by predicting periods of generation and curtailment and matching use and charging to suit.

If it were possible to anticipate these events the above, other projects and the system as a whole would be able to operate much more effectively.

## Proposal

Data will be collected and analysed with a view to producing models reflecting the consumption, generation and curtailment of electricity in the county.

It is proposed that combining weather data, electricity consumption and generation data/models, it may be possible to create a model that reflects the system and can produce likely scenarios for curtailment.

## Data sources
SSE publish the current electricity demand and generation for Orkney as well as the current curtailment (ANM) status on their website. Historical data is not published.

The majority of generation comes from wind turbines so clearly, generation will be affected by wind speed and possibly by direction.  The met office(*ref*) produces limited historical data.  Historical data for Kirkwall airport is available on (ref* weatherhq)

With a view to predicting curtailment, weather forecasts may also be relevant. Again, the MET office has a useful service (*ref*)

National figures and patterns of electricity consumption can be viewed on (ref* gridwatch)

A local domestic property publishes comprehensive generation data from a 5kW evince wind turbine. (*ref sunnyportal*)

## Methodology

* Automated systems for recording data from SSEN website and met office will be required.

* Historical weather data and domestic generation data will need to be obtained and transformed into a useable format.

* Electricity consumption in Orkney will also be affected by a number of factors such as the weather (e.g. additional heating on cold days) and the time of year (e.g. number of hours of darkness), amongst others.  It is further complicated by the large number (>700) of domestic wind turbines that reduce demand from the grid (this figure not measured by SSEN).  Some effort to understand and model this will be undertaken.

* Data sets will be compared and analysed using 'R' statistical computing and graphics software.

* Machine learning tools, such as tensorflow, will be assessed for their effectiveness.
